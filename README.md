# Project Name: GrowRight  
## Fertiliser & Input Calculator USSD Platform Specification

### Executive Summary

GrowRight Assist is an inclusive, mobile-first platform that empowers smallholder farmers by delivering fertiliser and seed input recommendations through an intuitive USSD interface. Farmers enter their land size and crop type, and instantly receive SMS-based guidance on the optimal quantity of inputs required, application timing, and nearby agro-suppliers.

This solution addresses input misapplication in rural farming communities, driving productivity, reducing cost, and building digital bridges between farmers and agricultural value chains.

We seek strategic partnerships and investment to launch, scale, and deepen our impact in rural Africa.

### Problem Statement

Over 70% of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa operate without access to:
- Technical agronomic guidance
- Trusted suppliers for inputs
- Tools for accurate fertiliser or seed calculation

This results in:
- Over or under-application of inputs
- Increased cost, poor yields
- Environmental degradation
- Reliance on anecdotal advice

### 💡 Our Solution

A USSD and SMS-based mobile calculator that:
- Asks farmers for crop type and land size
- Calculates precise fertiliser/seed requirement
- Sends SMS with input details and the nearest verified suppliers
- Offers multilingual support and works on any GSM phone
